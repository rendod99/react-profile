    <p class="lead">I’m a FullStack web developer with a background in Retail Management. 
        I am Currently Enrolled in a FullStack Web Developer Coding Bootcamp at the University of San Antonio. 
        During my time in this course I have developed skills in Javascript,CSS and in Responsive web design. I have always been able to multitask and prioritize tasks to get the job at hand completed on time. 
        I have worked alone and with groups and have recently completed a group application that Utilizes Jquery and  API calls to find local nearby restaurants for consumers. 
        I’m excited to use the skills I have learned throughout my career and in this course.Apply them to make quality and efficient applications for a more user friendly experience on the web.</p>
